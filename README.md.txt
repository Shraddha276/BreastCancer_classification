# Breast Cancer Classification

This project uses the BreastCancer dataset from the `mlbench` R package to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using a Random Forest classifier.

## Steps
1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the Random Forest model.
4. Predict and evaluate model accuracy.
5. Analyze feature importance.

## How to Run
1. Open RStudio.
2. Open `breast_cancer_classification.R`.
3. Install required packages: tidyverse, caret, randomForest, mlbench.
4. Source the script to run.
